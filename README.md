## Executive Summary

### The Data Science Process

**Problem Statement**

I have clients who want to invest in houses either by selling or buying.  They want to know what features are going to most influence the price of the house.  The information I am presenting should help them to make an informed decision.
The goal of this project is to help my clients find a desired house for a decent price by building a regression model that will best predict the sale price.  The data I use is from Ames Housing Spreadsheet

**Data Cleaning and EDA**
- Are missing values dealt with?
- Are important distributions examined and described?
- Are outliers identified and addressed?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are possible modeling insights to investigate discussed?

**Preprocessing and Modeling**
- Are categorical variables one-hot encoded or encoded in another logical way?
- Are features engineered?
- Have the data been scaled appropriately?
- Does the student properly split the data for validation/training purposes?
- Does the student use feature selection to remove noisy or multi-collinear features?
- Does the student test and evaluate a variety of model types (**AT MINIMUM:** linear regression, lasso, and ridge)?
- Does the student defend their choice of the best model for this data and problem statement?
- Does the student explain how the model works and evaluate its performance successes/downfalls?

**Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding**
- Does the student accurately identify and explain the baseline score?
- Does the student select and use metrics relevant to the problem statement?
- Is more than one metric uses to better assess performance?
- Does the student correctly interpret the results of their model for purposes of inference?

**Conclusion and Recommendations**

I have identified what features are the best predictors of housing price.  I have addressed missing data and outliers and improved my model by Ridge and Lasso.  I finally have created a regression model and was able to generate new data to predict sale price.  Now I can recommend the following to my clients:

- Invest in a house with a large living area  
- Invest in a house that has good overall quality
- Invest in a house that was built recently
- Invest in a house that has more full bath rooms
- Invest in a house with higher basement square footage
